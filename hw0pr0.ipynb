    "a) I think the \"metaverse\"-like immersive experience is a wonderful advancement in technology as it will make things and experiences that are hard to access, more accessible for everyone. However, I think that with the 2020-2021 \"Zoom era\" experience, people will value in-person, non-virtual experiences much more. I think virtual events will be a rare ocassion, but people will try to transition back to \"normal\" life after the pandemic. However, far into the future, maybe \"metaverse\"-like immersive experiences will be more common and in a switch of events, it will be the non-virtual events that are rare and exciting and different (and unfortunately probably only available for the super rich).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) I think the \"deeply mediated\" experiences offered by new technology like VR are ethics-promoting. They offer the oppurtunity for people to gain new perspectives on life that they otherwise may have never done in person. Also, virtual experiences will hopefully make experiences more accessible to wide ranges of people (if the technology can be supplied to everyone), helping to remove some of the inequalities in the world. In this way, the \"deeply mediated\" experiences are promoting the public good which is one of the tenets of the Code. However, to completely be ethics-promoting, the developers must be able to distribute this technology to everyone, if not, it will only excaberate already existing inequalities."
